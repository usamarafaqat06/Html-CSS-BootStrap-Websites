                      <p>Whether you’re planning well ahead and want to invest in the right pension, or are approaching retirement and want 
                        to secure the best possible annuity,  we provide our clients with the best possible free pension advice so they can 
                        make appropriate financial decisions based on what is right for them and their families.
                      </p>
                      <p>The advice is both technically accurate and independent, which means you can be sure that our recommendations 
                        are in your interests, and no one else’s.
                      </p>
                      <p>But before any recommendations are offered, we always start with an assessment of your current situation, to see 
                        whether you would benefit from taking out a new pension or transferring your existing one to another provider. This 
                        involves an initial free pension review, which we can do over the phone and won’t take very long.
                      </p>
                      <p>If we think we can be of help, and in the majority of cases the people we speak to would benefit from making a 
                        pension switch, then one of our free pension advisors will carry out a more comprehensive analysis.
                      </p>
                      <h3>transffering pensions for a better retirement</h3>
                      <p>Unfortunately, many people never get around to doing this because they believe they’re locked into their existing 
                        pension, especially if they have had it for a while. Or they think that changing their pension provider will be a 
                        long-winded and difficult process that isn’t worth bothering with.
                      </p>
                      <p>In fact, with the right help and advice, transferring pensions doesn’t have to be either time-consuming or complicated. 
                        That means it’s perfectly possible for you to escape from an expensive or poorly performing pension and take of 
                        advantage of much better deals that are now on offer.

                <p>Pension Review Group is a lead generation and marketing company for the financial services industry. We do not offer regulated finance advice as 
                  all enquiries are passed onto Independent Financial Advisers. The basis of the initial pension review is to collate information to pass onto the 
                  Independent Financial Adviser and to inform people of the type of products available which are bespoke to the scheme providers that they 
                  have access to. </p>

        <p>Even though you try to avoid accidents, you can be injured
          because another person wasn’t watching out for your safety.
          Whether it was a <a href="#">slip-and-fall,</a> a <a href="#">car accident</a>, a <a href="#"> medical
            injury</a> ,
          a product injury, or some other type of accident, you deserve monetary
          compensation for the injuries and damages someone else has forced upon you.
        </p>
        <p>Filing a <a href="#">personal injury claim or lawsuit in Phoenix </a>
          is not something the average person can do on their own.
          There are complex laws that can affect your case, as well as
          difficult negotiations and paperwork you will have to complete.
          You must also accurately calculate your losses,
          investigate the accident, and collect evidence to prove negligence.
        </p>
        <p>ou deserve to have the help of a dedicated, meticulous legal professional who can guide you through every
          step of the Phoenix personal injury claim process. You should be able to focus on recovering from your
          injuries and getting back to work. That’s why it’s important for you to reach out to a
          Phoenix injury lawyer at the Law Offices of Michael Cordova.
        </p>
        <p>Don’t delay in calling a lawyer at our office.
          Most Arizona injury cases require you to submit your claim
          within two years of the date of your accident. Failure to
          submit your claim within this time frame will prevent you
          and your family from receiving the compensation you’re owed.
